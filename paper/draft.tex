      This paper investigates (1) the price elasticity of giving and (2) whether the different perception towards the government cause the different giving behavior using South Korean panel data. Our result classifies that the price elasticity of giving in Korea is -0.59 \textasciitilde{} -1.01 for intensive margin and -1.17 \textasciitilde{} -1.48 for extensive margin. We also show that the amount of donation is not different between those who regard government as inefficient and the others, though the giving price elasticity of the former is more elastic than the latter. This means that those who think of government as inefficient have more willingness to donate for 1\% reduction of giving price.

  \section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

  In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving. This is because, if subsidizing charitable giving induces a large increase in donations, it is desirable for public good provision. To evaluate the effect of tax relief, many papers investigate the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price (Almunia et al., 2020; Auten et al., 2002; Bakija and Heim, 2011; Fack and Landais, 2010; Randolph, 1995). Focusing on the tax deduction or tax credit on the charity, they show that the price elasticity of giving is about -1 or more in terms of absolute value, which means that the tax relief for the charitable giving is good in the sense that 1\% tax relief derives more than 1\% donation.

  This paper follows the literature of charitable donation and tax relief and investigates the price elasticity of giving. To derive the elasticity, this paper utilize the South Korean (Korea hereafter) tax reform in 2014, from when the tax relief on charitable giving was conducted by tax credit, though tax deduction had been used before 2014.

  The extant research mainly focuses on the tax reform within the regime of tax deduction (Almunia et al., 2020; Auten et al., 2002; Bakija and Heim, 2011; Randolph, 1995) or tax credit (Fack and Landais, 2010). However, there is no research which deal with the giving tax reform between the regime of tax deduction and tax credit as far as we know. Since the extant research focus on the tax reform within the scheme of tax deduction or tax credit, this paper firstly deals with the tax reform from tax deduction system to tax credit system. In this literature, it is well known that tax payers can manipulate their tax rate using charitable giving in the tax deduction regime although such a manipulation cannot be observed in tax credit regime. Thus, by focusing on the regime change between tax deduction and tax credit, we could employ the methods to examine the tax elasticity with less influence of the manipulation.(この記述は要検討)

  The Korean tax reform in 2014 started to allow 15\% of the total amount of charitable giving as a tax credit for all taxpayers, which means that the giving price for 1 KRW donation is 0.85 KRW. Since the giving price was determined according to the marginal tax rate of progressive income tax before 2014, this tax reform reduced the giving price for low income taxpayers while it increased the price for high income tax payers. Since the variation of giving price can be considered to be exogenous for taxpayers, we exploit this reform and conduct the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis. As a result, our estimation shows that the price elasticity of giving in Korea is -0.59 \textasciitilde{} -1.01 for intensive margin and -1.17 \textasciitilde{} -1.48 for extensive margin.

  This paper mainly contributes the literature about the tax elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price. The examples of papers in this strand are Randolph (1995), Auten et al. (2002), Fack and Landais (2010), Bakija and Heim (2011), and Almunia et al. (2020). They typically use the tax return data, the main part of which is the data about wealthy people. Since our data is based on survey, which reflects the income distribution of population, we believe that we can estimate the giving price elasticity of population more precisely. Using the data with low-income households may be difficult to estimate the giving price elasticity in terms of intensive margin since they are expected to donate less than high-income households. To address this issue, we estimate not only the elasticity of intensive margin, as most of papers do, but also the elasticity of extensive margin following Almunia et al. (2020).
  Moreover, we use the data of Korea, a non-Western country, which the extant research did not examine.\footnote{This point may be important since Kim (2021) reports that the giving behavior is strongly affected by the cultural matter such as the religious belief.}

  This paper consist of seven sections. Section 2 and 3 respectively explain the institutional background and data. Section 4 explains the estimation method. Section 5 deals with the analysis of giving price elasticity and section 6 shows the analysis of perceptions toward the government. Section 7 concludes.

  \section{Institutional background}\label{institutional-background}}

  In this section, we describe the income tax relief for charitable giving in Korea and used dataset.

  \subsection{Tax relief for charitable giving by tax deduction and tax credit}\label{tax-relief-for-charitable-giving-by-tax-deduction-and-tax-credit}}

  In the South Korea, the tax policy about charitable giving drastically changed in 2014. Before then, tax relief of charitable giving was provided by tax deduction while, from 2014, tax relief by tax credit was introduced instead of tax deduction.

  The tax deduction and tax credit may have different effects on giving behavior. This subsection summarize the difference of tax deduction and tax credit.
  Consider that a household has a choice between private consumptions (\(x_i\)) and charitable giving (\(g_i\)). Let \(y_i\) be pre-tax total income.
  Then, the budget constraint is

  \[
      x_i + g_i = y_i - T_i(y_i, g_i).
  \]
  \(T_i\) is tax amount which depends on the pre-tax income and charitable giving.
  On one hand, tax deduction reduces taxable income by giving. The amount of tax is

  \[
      T_i = \tau(y_i - g_i) \cdot (y_i - g_i),
  \]

  where \(\tau(\cdot)\) is the income tax rate which is determined by \(y_i - g_i\).\footnote{\(\tau(\cdot)\) here is a function which shows the average tax rate, which is determined progressively. Since the price elasticity of giving shows the marginal and additional increment for one unit of price reduction increase, we use not average but marginal tax rate to construct the giving price following the literature. Usage of the function of the average tax rate here is for explanatory simplicity.} The budget constraint will be

  \[
      x_i + [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)]g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)] y_i.
  \]

  Thus, the giving price compared to the price of private consumption is \(p_i^{d} \equiv 1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)\) in tax deduction system. Since the giving price in tax deduction scheme varies depending on (1) the income level and (2) the amount of charitable giving, it is endogenous to them, i.e.~(1) and (2).

  On the other hand, tax credit reduces tax amount directly, that is,

  \[
      T_i = \tau(y_i)\cdot y_i - m g_i,
  \]

  where \(m \in [0, 1]\) is the tax credit rate. Under the tax credit system, the budget constraint is

  \[
      x_i + (1 - m) g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i)] y_i.
  \]

  Thus, the giving price of tax credit system will be \(p_i^c = 1 - m\), which is only dependent on the tax credit rate \(m\), which is exogenously determined by the government.
  Therefore, the giving price in the tax credit system would not be manipulated by donors.

  \subsection{Korean tax reform in 2014}\label{korean-tax-reform-in-2014}}

  The tax incentives for charitable giving in Korea stared in 1967 and the market of charitable giving in Korea totaled 10.9 trillion KRW (approximately 1.09 bilion USD, 0.761\% of GDP) in 2012 according to the national tax statistics.
  Since the income tax deduction was initially used as a tax incentive and the marginal income tax rate was determined as Table \ref{tab:tabTaxRate}, the minimum giving price before 2014 was 0.62.

  \end{table}

  In 2014, aiming at the relaxation of regressivity of giving price, the Korean government reformed tax system again, where the tax credit was introduced instead of tax deduction. Since then, 15\% of the total amount of charitable giving has been allowed as a tax credit, which means that the giving price from 2014 is 0.85 irrelevant to the income level.

  Summarizing this, compared to tax credit system, the high income household, whose (average) income tax rate is more than 15\%, get benefit from charitable giving under the tax deduction system. However, middle or low income households would enjoy tax relief in tax credit system more than tax deduction system. We exploit this policy change as an identification strategy.

  \subsection{National Survey of Tax and Benefit (NaSTaB)}\label{national-survey-of-tax-and-benefit-nastab}}

  In this paper, we use panel data from the National Survey of Tax and Benefit (NasTaB).
  NasTaB survey is an annual financial panel survey
  implemented by The Korea Institute of Taxation and Finance
  to study the tax burden of households and the benefits that households receive from government.
  The subjects of this survey are general household and household members living in 15 cities
  and provinces nationwide.
  This survey is based on a face-to-face interview.
  If it is difficult for investigators to meet subjects, another family member answers on behalf of him.\footnote{Note that NasTaB data is constructed as the subjects represent the population of Korean society. This enables us to derive giving price elasticity of population without re-weighting samples, which is used in the extant research. Moreover, note that subjects are not limited to the tax payer or income earner reflecting the population.}

  In the analysis, we use data from 2013 to 2019 since we focus on the 2014 tax reform. This is because, as Table \ref{tab:tabTaxRate} shows, the giving price before 2014 was changed frequently and incorporating the data before 2012 captures the effects of another tax reform than the reform in 2014. Note that, since tax credit was introduced after 2014 and the credit rate was unchanged since 2014, the giving price does not depend on the income tax rate after 2014.
  In addition, we exclude the subject of the sample, whose age is under 23, since they are not likely to have income or asset.

  Table \ref{tab:kableSummaryCovariate} is summary statistics of our sample.
  We used four types of variables in this paper:
  sets of variables about Income and Giving Price,
  Charitable Donations,
  Government Efficiency,
  and Individual Characteristics.
  A set of variables about Government Efficiency is constructed from the value survey of NasTaB data.
  Current Tax-Welfare Balance shows how the subject perceives the balance between tax burden and received welfare from the government,
  while Ideal Tax-Welfare Balance indicates what is the ideal balance between tax burden and received welfare for the subject.
  The higher values of them means that received welfare from the government is higher than tax burden.
  We explain the details and constructions of these variables later.
  The variables about Individual Characteristics,
  which consist from age, gender and final education levels, are used as control variables.

  In the next two subsections,
  we describe the first two set of variables in detail.

  \hypertarget{income-and-giving-price}{%
  \subsection{Income and Giving Price}\label{income-and-giving-price}}

  NaSTaB asks respondents to answer the annual income last year.
  For example, in the 2014 survey, respondents answer the annual income at 2013.
  In our sample, the average annual taxable income is 18.76 million KRW.
  According to the National Tax Statistical Yearbook published by Korean National Tax Service,
  the average annual taxable income is 32.77 million from 2012 to 2018
  for employees who submited the tax return.
  Since our sample includes subjects with no labor income, such as housewife,
  our sample mean of income is lower than average income calculated by the public organizations.
  In Figure \ref{fig:showSummaryPriceChange},
  the gray bars show the distribution of annual taxable income in 2013.
  The income distribution is left-skewed.

  Using this variable, we construct the giving price under the tax deduction system (2012 and 2013).
  After the tax reform (after 2014), the giving price is 0.85 under the tax credit system,
  as we explained in the section \ref{institutional-background}.
  In Figure \ref{fig:showSummaryPriceChange},
  the blue line shows giving price in 2012 and 2013,
  while the red dashed line shows the giving price after 2014.
  From this figure,
  those whose annual income is less than 1200 in 2013 could receive benefit by the 2014 tax reform
  bacause the tax reform decreases the giving price.
  On the other hand,
  those whose auunal income is greater than 4600 in 2013 had a loss by the 2014 tax reform
  since the tax reform increases the giving price.

  \hypertarget{charitable-giving}{%
  \subsection{Charitable Giving}\label{charitable-giving}}

  NaSTaB asks respondents to answer the amount of donation.\footnote{Respondents answer the amount of donation for seven specific purposes last year. Seven specific purposes are policitical parties, educational organizations, social welfare organizations, organizations for culutre and art, religious groups, charity activies organaized by religious group, other purposes.We sum up the amount of donations, and consider it as the annual charitable giving.}
  We use this variable as an first outcome variable when
  estimating the price effect on the amount of donations among donors (intensive margin).
  Using this variable, we make a dummy variable taking 1 if repsondents donate (Dummy of Donation).
  This is the second outcome variable
  to estimate the price effect on the decision of donations (extensive margin).

  Table \ref{tab:kableSummaryCovariate} shows that
  the average amount of donation is almost 300,000 KRW,
  and the proportion of donors is roughly 20\%.
  Figure \ref{fig:showDonationRate} shows the time-series of two variables.
  The blue line shows the average amount of donation among donors.
  In each year, its value is nearly 1.5 million KRW,
  which is 7\% of average annual taxable income.
  The grey bar shows the proportion of donors.
  After the tax reform, the proportion of donors decreases by 2\%.
  After that, the proportion of donors is greter than 20\%.

  \hypertarget{estimation}{%
  \section{Estimation}\label{estimation}}

  To estimate the giving price elasticity for intensive margin and extensive margin, we use DID analysis which exploit the fact that the giving price was unified in 2014 while the price was different for tax payers with different incomes.

  Following Almunia et al. (2020), we estimate the giving price elasticity for intensive margin and extensive margin. The elasticity of intensive margin shows how much donors additionally donates reacting to the marginal increase of giving price, while the elasticity of extensive margin shows how much the probability to donate changes reacting to marginal increase of giving price.

  We estimate the elasticity of intensive margin using the following specification:

  \begin{equation}
      \ln g_{it} = \varepsilon_{INT} \ln p_{it} +g_{INT} \ln y_{it} + X_{it}\beta +\mu_i +\iota_t +u_{it}. \label{eq:intensive}
  \end{equation}

  \(g_{it}, p_{it}\) and \(y_{it}\) respectively indicates the amount of giving, the giving price, and income of \(i\) in year \(t\). \(\mu_i, \iota_t\) and \(u_{it}\) are individual fixed effect, year fixed effect and error term, respectively.
  The individual fixed effect controls for time-invariant individual characteristics. The year fixed effect controls for events that affect all subjects at the same time. \(X_{it}\) is a vector of covariates which include variables about education and gender. Moreover, we add some interaction terms between year fixed effect and control variables into \(X_{it}\), since they will control for events that affects subject with specific characteristics at the same time following Zeldow and Hatfield (2019).

  The elasticity of extensive margin is estimated using the linear probability model such as

  \begin{equation}
  D_{it} =  \delta \ln p_{it} +\gamma \ln y_{it} + X_{it}\beta+\mu_i  +\iota_t +v_{it}. \label{eq:extensive}
  \end{equation}

  \(D_{it}\) is a dummy variable taking 1 if individual \(i\) donates at year \(t\) and 0 otherwise.
  Since we use the linear probability model,
  the estimated coefficient \(\delta\) represents \(\hat{\delta} = \frac{\partial D_{it}}{\partial p_{it}} p_{it}\).
  Also, the estimated coefficient \(\gamma\) represents \(\hat{\gamma} = \frac{\partial D_{it}}{\partial y_{it}} y_{it}\).
  Thus, the extensive-margin price and income elasticity are \(\hat{\delta}/D_{it}\) and \(\hat{\gamma}/D_{it}\), respectively.
  We evaluate the extensive-margin price and income elasticity at sample mean of \(D_{it}\).

  Our identification assumption is the \emph{within} price variation is exogenous because we use the fixed effect model.
  This assumption may be hold if the major \emph{within} price variation comes only from the 2014 tax reform.
  After the 2014 tax reform (the tax credit system), the giving price is constant across individuals and
  there is no room for manipulation by donations and income.
  However, before the 2014 tax reform, the giving price has two potential endogeneity problem:
  (A) endogeneity of giving price and (B) simulatenous determination of income and donations.

  To tackle these problems, we take two methods.
  The first method deals with the possibility that the giving price is endogenous because
  the tax payer can reduce their giving price by increasing their amount of donation and shifting themselves to the lower tax bracket in the tax deduction system.
  Since this issue does not happen for the first one unit of donation, whose price (``first price'') cannot be changed by adjusting the donation, we use this first price as the giving price in the estimation.
  The first price is formally defined as the giving price \(p_i^d \equiv 1 - \tau (y_i - g_i)\), evaluated at \(g_i = 0\).
  Moreover, this issue does not happen in the tax credit system because the giving price in the tax credit system is exogenously determined by the rate of tax credit allowance.
  Therefore, we construct the giving price in the tax credit system based on the rate of tax credit allowance.

  The second method deals with the issue related to the simultaneous determination of income and donations.
  Under the tax deduction system,
  the change of income have effects on both donations through the income effect and the giving price through the marginal tax rate.
  Therefore, we employ lagged values of taxable income and construct a variable for the change in the first price of giving as following:

  \[
  \ln \left(\frac{p_{it}(y_{it-k} - g_{it-k})}{p_{it-k}(y_{it-k} - g_{it-k})}\right).
  \]

  where \(g_{it-k} = 0\).
  The numerator is the first price that individual \(i\) would have faced in year \(t\) if she had declared her year \((t - k)\) taxable income at that year.
  By fixing the income at year \(t - k\),
  the instrument isolates changes in price from income responses to the tax reform.
  Note that this problem does not happen for the tax credit system, where the giving price is the same across all individuals.

  \subsection{Price and Income Elasticity}\label{price-and-income-elasticity}}

  Before the estimation of giving price elasticities for intensive and extensive margin, we estimate the elasticity without distinguishing them. We call this elasticity as overall elasticity.
  Table \ref{tab:kableEstimateElasticityPart1} shows estimation results of overall elasticity.
  The column (1) is the baseline estimation, which include individual and time fixed effects.
  The price elasticity is rougly -1, which is statistically significant different from zero.
  This implies that 1\% increase of giving price raise charitable giving by 1\%.
  This result is in line with previous researches which focus on Western countries.
  The income elasticity is about 5.3, which is statistically significant different from zero.
  This implies that 1\% increase of annual income raise charitable giving by 5.3\%.
  The remaining four columns control for events that affects subject with specific characteristics at the same time.
  As a result, the price elasticity is more elastic than the baseline result.
  The price elasticity lies between -1.3 and -1.1.
  On the other hand, the income elasticity is less elastic than the baseline result.
  The income elasticity lies between -5.1 and -4.9.

  \end{threeparttable}
  \end{table}

  Table \ref{tab:kableEstimateElasticityPart2} shows the intensive-margin and the extensive-margin elasticities.
  The first panel shows the intensive-margin elasticity.
  Compared to the overall elasticitiy, the price and income elasticitiy are less elastic.
  Controlling individual and time fixed effects,
  the price and income elasticity is about -0.6 and about 2,
  which are statistically significant different from zero (See the column (1)).
  Moreover, when we include the interaction term between individual characteristics and year dummies,
  these values vary.
  The price elasticity lies between -1.1 and -0.8,
  and the income elasticity lies between 1.4 and 1.6.
  Anyway, our conlusion is that the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price among donors.

  The second panel shows the extensive-margin elasticity.
  By results of overall elasticities and the intensive-margin elasticities,
  we expect that the extensive-margin price and income elasticity is more elastic than the overall elasticities.
  In the column (1), the coefficient of logged giving price and logged annual income are -0.257 and 1.175 respectively,
  which are statistically significant different from zero.
  Since we use the linear probability model,
  we need to calculate \(\epsilon^p_{EXT} = -0.257/D_{it}\) and \(\epsilon^y_{EXT} = 1.175/D_{it}\)
  to obtain the price and income elasticity, respectively.
  Especially, the coefficient of logged giving price represents the lower-bound of price elasticity
  because the variable \(D_{it}\) takes either 0 or 1.
  When we evaluate the price elasticity at the sample mean of \(D_{it}\),
  the implied price elasticity is -1.264, which is slightly more elastic than the overall one.
  Also, we evaluate the income elasticity at the sample mean of outcome.
  The implied income elasticity is 5.778, which is slightly more elastic than the overall one.
  Although the implied price and income elasticity varies with covariates,
  results are in line with our expectation.
  Thus, the decision of donations is sensitive to the giving price and annual income.

  In summary, our first conclusion is that
  the decision of donations is sensitive to the giving price,
  and the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price once they decide to donate.
  In the next subsection, we check the robustness of our first conclusion, using three methods.

  \hypertarget{robustness-check}{%
  \subsection{Robustness Check}\label{robustness-check}}

  The first robustness check estimates the last price elasticity using the first price of giving as an instrument.
  Our main results show that \emph{first} price elasticity to avoid the endogeneity of giving price.
  However, the first price elasiticity is not realistic
  because people face the \emph{last} marginal price when deciding amount of donations.
  Thus, we estimate the \emph{last} price elasticity, using the Panel IV method.

  There is one caution to interpret the last price elasticity.
  Under the tax credit system, the last price elasticity is equivalent to the first one.
  Since major observation units are observed when the tax credit system is implemented,
  the last giving price is strongly correlated with the first one.
  In other words, covariates between the last and first giving price is roughly equal to one.
  In the first stage, the coefficient of first giving price is roughly 0.98 in any specifications.\footnote{We do not show the first-stage results. Instead, we show the F-statistics of the instrument variable.}
  Thus, our last price elasticity may be upper bound of true price elasticity.

  The last price elasticity is in line with our first conclusion.
  Table \ref{tab:kableLastElasticity1} shows overall last price elasticity.
  Compared to the main results, the last price elasticity is more elastic.
  The aboslute value of estimated coefficient is larger than 2.4,
  which is statistically significant different from zero.
  This implies that 1\% increase of last price decreases charitable contributions by 2.4\% or more.
  Table \ref{tab:kableLastElasticity2} shows the intensive-margin and extensive-margin last price elasticity.
  In the first panel,
  the intensive-margin last price elasticity is similar value to the main results.
  Its abolute value lies between 0.89 and 1.2.
  These results are statistically different from zero.
  In the second panel,
  the coefficient of logged last price, which represents the lower bound of last price elasticity,
  lies between -0.63 and -0.59.
  The implied last price elasticity evalueated at the sample mean of \(D_{it}\) is roughly -3.
  These results are statistically significant different from zero,
  and more elastic than the first price elasticity.

  In the second robustness check, we try to control the manipulation of giving price by adjusting income level using two datasets whose ranges are (i) from 2013 to 2018 and (ii) from 2013 to 2014. Under the tax deduction system, the giving price can be manipulated by income level, though it cannot under the tax credit system. Therefore, if we use the dataset which contains data under the the tax deduction system, the estimator may capture the effect of price change which is caused not by tax reform but by price manipulation by income adjustment. To address this issue, we use dataset in which the time range under the tax deduction system is shorter than the baseline analysis. By doing this exercise, we try to suppress the effect which comes from the price change due to the change of income.

  Table \ref{tab:kableShortElasticity1} shows the overall first giving price elasticity.
  When we use data from 2013 to 2018, the estimated price elasticity is similar value to the main results.
  On the other hand,
  when we use data from 2013 to 2014, the estimated price elasticity is more elastic than the main results.
  The estimated absolute value is roughly -1.7 when we control covariates and its interaction with year dummies.
  This value is statistically significant different from zero.

  The third robustness check is to estimate the \(k\)-th difference model. The tax reform may have impacts on the giving price in two ways: one is direct giving price change by tax reform and the other is indirect change via wealth effect, which is induced by tax reform. Thus, to isolate the direct effect of the tax reform, we use the information of income level \(k\) years before.
  Concreately speaking, we estimate the \(k\)-th difference model formulated as follows:
  \[
  \Delta^k \ln g_{it} = \delta \Delta^k \ln p_{it} + \gamma \Delta^k \ln y_{it} + \Delta^k X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \iota_t + v_{it},
  \]
  where \(\Delta^k \ln g_{it} = \ln g_{it} - \ln g_{it-k}\) and \(\Delta^k \ln y_{it} = \ln y_{it} - y_{it-k}\).

  The variable \(\Delta^k p_{it}\) is defined as \(\Delta^k p_{it} \equiv \ln p_{it}(y_{it-k}) - \ln p_{it}(y_{it-k})\).\footnote{Under the tax credit system, the giving price does not depend on income \(y_{it-k}\). If the tax credit system is impelemted in year \(t\) and \(t-k\), then the value of \(\Delta^k p_{it}\) takes zero.}
  The variation of this variable comes from the tax reform because we fix the annual income at year \(t - k\).
  Therefore, we can interpret this coefficient as the giving price elasticity due to the tax reform.
  In particular, the estimated \(\delta\) implies that 1\% increase of the change of giving price leads to \(\hat{\delta}\)\% increase of the change of charitable giving.
  Note that we do not estimate the extensive-margin elasticity because it is hard to interpret this estimation equation when we use \(\Delta^k D_{it}\) as an outcome variable.

  Table \ref{tab:kablekDiffElasticity} shows results of \(k\)-th difference model.
  The first panel shows the overall elasticity.
  When we take the one year lag (\(k = 1\)), the overall price elasticity is roughly -1.9,
  which is statistically significant.
  This elasticity slightly varies when we take the two or more year lag (\(k > 1\)).
  The overall price elasticity lies between -2.1 and -1.7, which is statistically significant.
  This implies that the overall price elasticity obtained by this model is more elastic than the main results.
  The second panel shows the intensive-margin elasticity.
  When we take the one year lag (\(k = 1\)), the intensive-margin price elasticity is roughly -1.8,
  which is statistically significant.
  The absolute value of the price elasticity is more than 2
  when we take two or more year lag (\(k > 1\)).
  Thus, contrary to our first conclusion,
  this model implies that the amount of donations is sensitive to the giving price once we decide to donate.

  In summary, the result shows that the size of estimated elasticity may vary depending on the estimation methods. This may be because the sample size is small compared to the extant research. However, our three robustness checks are in line with the baseline result, which shows that the price elasticity of intensive margin is less elastic than one of extensive margin. Thus, the obtained results suggest that the decision to donate is sensitive to the giving price, though the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price once they decide to donate.

  \section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

  In this paper, we investigate the giving price elasticity and its heterogeneity as for perception towards the government using South Korean panel data. As a result, we obtain two findings.

  Firstly, the estimation shows that the giving price elasticity in Korea is larger than 1 in the sense of absolute value. Although the estimated values seem vulnerable for the estimation method, most of results show that the giving price elasticity is more elastic for extensive margin than intensive margin. This implies that the policymakers should consider not only how much donors additionally pay (intensive margin) but also how many people will be donors (extensive margin) for tax reform.

  Secondly, we show that the giving price elasticity for those who think that the government is inefficient is more elastic than the others. Although the previous research shows that those who do not believe the efficiency of the government would donate more than the others, our result firstly shows that such a behavior may depend on the giving price.

  From the results, we show that the giving price elasticity would be affected by the efficiency of the government. However, researchers may find the difference of giving behavior as for the other dimensions of heterogeneities. To understand the giving behavior and to contribute the policy making, more sophisticated research is neeeded.
