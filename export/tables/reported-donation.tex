\item Notes: * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$. Standard errors clustered at the household level are in parentheses. We use only wage earners. An outcome variable is the transformed logged value of the reported donation, which is a product of an indicator of report and an amount of donation and is defined as $\log(R\tilde{g})$ for $Rg > 0$ and $-1$ for $Rg=0$, where $\tilde{g}=g/min_{g>0}[g]$. The value of the minimum nonzero donation, $min_{g>0}[g]$, in our data is 2,000KRW. In addition to logged income, covariates consist of squared age (divided by 100), number of household members, number of children, number of dependents, a dummy that indicates the highest income in a household, a dummy that indicates that a taxpayer is household head, a set of industry dummies, a set of residential area dummies, and individual and time fixed effects.
