We found the **price effect** of giving (1\% price increase leads to about 1.1\% giving decrease),
and the **income effect** of giving(1\% income increase leads to about 5\% giving increase).
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
Before the estimation of giving price elasticities for intensive and extensive margin, we estimate the elasticity without distinguishing them. We call this elasticity as overall elasticity.
Table \@ref(tab:MainOverall) shows estimation results of overall elasticity.
The column (1) is the baseline estimation, which include individual and time fixed effects.
The price elasticity is rougly -1, which is statistically significant different from zero.
This implies that 1\% increase of giving price raise charitable giving by 1\%.
This result is in line with previous researches which focus on Western countries.
The income elasticity is about 5.3, which is statistically significant different from zero.
This implies that 1\% increase of annual income raise charitable giving by 5.3\%.
The remaining four columns control for events that affects subject with specific characteristics at the same time.
As a result, the price elasticity is more elastic than the baseline result.
The price elasticity lies between -1.3 and -1.1.
On the other hand, the income elasticity is less elastic than the baseline result.
The income elasticity lies between -5.1 and -4.9.

## Intensive and Extensive Margin: Estimation Results

The intensive-margin price elasticity is -0.5 ~ -1\%. 
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
Table \@ref(tab:MainIntensive) shows the intensive-margin and the extensive-margin elasticities.
The first panel shows the intensive-margin elasticity.
Compared to the overall elasticitiy, the price and income elasticitiy are less elastic.
Controlling individual and time fixed effects, 
the price and income elasticity is about -0.6 and about 2,
which are statistically significant different from zero (See the column (1)).
Moreover, when we include the interaction term between individual characteristics and year dummies,
these values vary.
The price elasticity lies between -1.1 and -0.8,
and the income elasticity lies between 1.4 and 1.6.
Anyway, our conlusion is that the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price among donors.

```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "slide"}
## Intensive and Extensive Margin: Estimation Results

The extensive-margin price elasticity is -1.2 ~ -1.4\%. 
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
Table \@ref(tab:MainExtensive) shows the extensive-margin elasticity.
By results of overall elasticities and the intensive-margin elasticities,
we expect that the extensive-margin price and income elasticity is more elastic than the overall elasticities.
In the column (1), the coefficient of logged giving price and logged annual income are -0.257 and 1.175 respectively,
which are statistically significant different from zero.
Since we use the linear probability model,
we need to calculate $\epsilon^p_{EXT} = -0.257/D_{it}$ and $\epsilon^y_{EXT} = 1.175/D_{it}$
to obtain the price and income elasticity, respectively. 
Especially, the coefficient of logged giving price represents the lower-bound of price elasticity
because the variable $D_{it}$ takes either 0 or 1.
When we evaluate the price elasticity at the sample mean of $D_{it}$,
the implied price elasticity is -1.264, which is slightly more elastic than the overall one.
Also, we evaluate the income elasticity at the sample mean of outcome.
The implied income elasticity is 5.778, which is slightly more elastic than the overall one.
Although the implied price and income elasticity varies with covariates,
results are in line with our expectation.
Thus, the decision of donations is sensitive to the giving price and annual income.

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
In summary, our first conclusion is that 
the decision of donations is sensitive to the giving price, 
and the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price once they decide to donate.
In the next subsection, we check the robustness of our first conclusion, using three methods.
```

## Robustness Check

```{asis, echo = doctype == "slide"}
First potential concern: last price elasticity

- Our baseline results show the **first** price elasticity to avoid the endogeneity of giving price.
- We estimated the **last** price elasticity, using the Panel IV method.
    - The instrument is the first giving price.
    - Note that the last giving price is equal to the first giving price under the tax credit system.

## Robustness Check 1: Result

Overall last price elasticity increases twofold.
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
The first robustness check estimates the last price elasticity using the first price of giving as an instrument.
Our main results show that *first* price elasticity to avoid the endogeneity of giving price.
However, the first price elasiticity is not realistic
because people face the *last* marginal price when deciding amount of donations.
Thus, we estimate the *last* price elasticity, using the Panel IV method.

There is one caution to interpret the last price elasticity.
Under the tax credit system, the last price elasticity is equivalent to the first one.
Since major observation units are observed when the tax credit system is implemented,
the last giving price is strongly correlated with the first one.
In other words, covariates between the last and first giving price is roughly equal to one.
In the first stage, the coefficient of first giving price is roughly 0.98 in any specifications. [^fstage]
Thus, our last price elasticity may be upper bound of true price elasticity.


[^fstage]: We do not show the first-stage results. Instead, we show the F-statistics of the instrument variable.

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
The last price elasticity is in line with our first conclusion.
Table \@ref(tab:LastOverall) shows overall last price elasticity.
Compared to the main results, the last price elasticity is more elastic.
The aboslute value of estimated coefficient is larger than 2.4,
which is statistically significant different from zero.
This implies that 1\% increase of last price decreases charitable contributions by 2.4\% or more.
Table \@ref(tab:LastIntensive) and \@ref(tab:LastExtensive) shows
the intensive-margin and extensive-margin last price elasticity.
In the first panel, 
the intensive-margin last price elasticity is similar value to the main results.
Its abolute value lies between 0.89 and 1.2.
These results are statistically different from zero.
In the second panel,
the coefficient of logged last price, which represents the lower bound of last price elasticity,
lies between -0.63 and -0.59.
The implied last price elasticity evalueated at the sample mean of $D_{it}$ is roughly -3.
These results are statistically significant different from zero,
and more elastic than the first price elasticity.
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "slide"}
## Robust Check 2

Second potential concern: Price change due to the change of income
    
- Since the giving price under the tax deduction depends on the change of income, the *within* variation of giving price may be endogenous.
- To resolve this concern, we used the data (i) from 2013 to 2018 or (ii) from 2013 to 2014, and estimated the fixed effect model.
    - By this restriction, the *within* price variation of giving price is completely exgonenous.
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
In the second robustness check, we try to control the manipulation of giving price by adjusting income level using two datasets whose ranges are (i) from 2013 to 2018 and (ii) from 2013 to 2014. Under the tax deduction system, the giving price can be manipulated by income level, though it cannot under the tax credit system. Therefore, if we use the dataset which contains data under the the tax deduction system, the estimator may capture the effect of price change which is caused not by tax reform but by price manipulation by income adjustment. To address this issue, we use dataset in which the time range under the tax deduction system is shorter than the baseline analysis. By doing this exercise, we try to suppress the effect which comes from the price change due to the change of income.

Table \@ref(tab:ShortIntensive) and \@ref(tab:ShortExtensive) shows
the intensive-margin and the extensive-margin first price elasticity.
The first panel shows the intensive-margin elasticity.
When we use data from 2012 to 2018, the intensive-margin price elasiticity is similar to the main results,
which is statistically significant from zero.
However, when we use data from 2013 to 2014 and include only individual and time fixed effects,
the estimated coefficient is statistically insignificant different from zero.
By controlling covariates and its interaction with year dummies,
the intensive-margin price elasticity is -0.712, which is statistically significant.
The second panel shows the extensive-margin elasticity.
When we use data from 2012 to 2018, the extensive-margin price elasticity is similar to the main results,
which is statistically significant.
When we use data from 2013 to 2014, the extensive-margin price elasticity is more elastic than the main results.
Its absolute value is roughly -2, which is statistically significant.

## Robustness Check 3

Second potential concerns: the change of price due to the change of income

- To exclude this potential concerns, previous identification strategy uses the 2014 tax reform.
- We can also rule out this problem, using the change in the first giving price.
    - The change in the first giving price is $\ln(p_{it}(y_{it-k} - g_{it-k})/p_{it-k}(y_{it-k} - g_{it-k}))$ where $g_{it-k} = 0$.
    - Since we fix the income $y_{it-k}$, this variation comes from the tax reform.

## Robustness Check 3 (Cont'd)

Our estimation equation is 
$$\Delta^k \ln g_{it} = \delta \Delta^k \ln p_{it} + \gamma \Delta^k \ln y_{it} + \Delta^k X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \iota_t + v_{it},$$
where $\Delta^k Y_{it} = Y_{it} - Y_{it-k}$.

- Note that we cannot estimation the extensive-margin elasticity since it is hard to interapt this estimation equation when we use $\Delta^k D_{it}$ as an outcome.
- We estimate this model for $k = 1, 2, 3$.
```

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
The third robustness check is to estimate the $k$-th difference model. The tax reform may have impacts on the giving price in two ways: one is direct giving price change by tax reform and the other is indirect change via wealth effect, which is induced by tax reform. Thus, to isolate the direct effect of the tax reform, we use the information of income level $k$ years before.
Concreately speaking, we estimate the $k$-th difference model formulated as follows:
$$
\Delta^k \ln g_{it} = \delta \Delta^k \ln p_{it} + \gamma \Delta^k \ln y_{it} + \Delta^k X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \iota_t + v_{it},
$$
where $\Delta^k \ln g_{it} = \ln g_{it} - \ln g_{it-k}$ and $\Delta^k \ln y_{it} = \ln y_{it} - y_{it-k}$.


The variable $\Delta^k p_{it}$ is defined as $\Delta^k p_{it} \equiv \ln p_{it}(y_{it-k}) - \ln p_{it}(y_{it-k})$.[^Deltacredit]
The variation of this variable comes from the tax reform because we fix the annual income at year $t - k$.
Therefore, we can interpret this coefficient as the giving price elasticity due to the tax reform.
In particular, the estimated $\delta$ implies that 1\% increase of the change of giving price leads to $\hat{\delta}$\% increase of the change of charitable giving.
Note that we do not estimate the extensive-margin elasticity because it is hard to interpret this estimation equation when we use $\Delta^k D_{it}$ as an outcome variable.

[^Deltacredit]: Under the tax credit system, the giving price does not depend on income $y_{it-k}$. If the tax credit system is impelemted in year $t$ and $t-k$, then the value of $\Delta^k p_{it}$ takes zero.

```{asis, echo = doctype == "draft"}
Table \@ref(tab:kdiffOverall) and \@ref(tab:kdiffIntensive) shows results of $k$-th difference model.
The first panel shows the overall elasticity.
When we take the one year lag ($k = 1$), the overall price elasticity is roughly -1.9,
which is statistically significant.
This elasticity slightly varies when we take the two or more year lag ($k > 1$).
The overall price elasticity lies between -2.1 and -1.7, which is statistically significant.
This implies that the overall price elasticity obtained by this model is more elastic than the main results.
The second panel shows the intensive-margin elasticity.
When we take the one year lag ($k = 1$), the intensive-margin price elasticity is roughly -1.8,
which is statistically significant.
The absolute value of the price elasticity is more than 2
when we take two or more year lag ($k > 1$).
Thus, contrary to our first conclusion,
this model implies that the amount of donations is sensitive to the giving price once we decide to donate.

In summary, the result shows that the size of estimated elasticity may vary depending on the estimation methods. This may be because the sample size is small compared to the extant research. However, our three robustness checks are in line with the baseline result, which shows that the price elasticity of intensive margin is less elastic than one of extensive margin. Thus, the obtained results suggest that the decision to donate is sensitive to the giving price, though the amount of donations is insensitive to the giving price once they decide to donate.
