## Conclusions

Main message

- Both ITT approach and IV approach show that the giving price elasticity in Korea is around -1.
- It implies that the effect from the declaration cost, which has been ignored, is not so large in South Korea.

Some robustness

- Alothough we focus on price variation coming from tax reform and declaration of tax relief, price variation is also caused by a manipulation of giving and income.
- We take other empirical methodologies to control these problemes, and obtain similar results.

# Conclusions

In this paper, we investigate the giving price elasticity using South Korean panel data. As a result, we obtain the following findings.

Firstly, our baseline estimation shows that the giving price elasticity in Korea is less than -1.4 even if we take into account declaration cost of charitable giving. Since the literature of the tax expenditure for charitable giving suggests that the price elasticity is around -1, the result suggests that the impact of declaration cost may be big.

Secondly, we find that. compared to the baseline result, the estimated price elasticity using the data limited to tax filers takes -1.4 $\sim$ -1.6, which is similar values to the estimated elasticity in the extant research. It implies that the usage of tax return data leads to smaller price elasticity in terms of absolute value. 

From the results, we firstly show the giving price elasticity in Korea. However, many things to be considered are remaining. To understand the giving behavior and to contribute the policy making, more sophisticated research is needed.
