  abstract = {A central tax policy parameter that has recently received much attention, but about which there is substantial uncertainty, is the overall elasticity of taxable income. We provide new estimates of this elasticity which address identification problems with previous work, by exploiting a long panel of tax returns to study a series of tax reforms throughout the 1980s. This identification strategy also allows us to provide new evidence on both the income effects of tax changes on taxable income, and on variation in the elasticity of taxable income by income group. We find that the overall elasticity of taxable income is approximately 0.4; the elasticity of real income, not including tax preferences, is much lower. We estimate small income effects of tax changes on reported income, implying that the compensated and uncompensated elasticities of taxable income are very similar. We estimate that this overall elasticity is primarily due to a very elastic response of taxable income for taxpayers who have incomes above \$100 000 per year, who have an elasticity of 0.57, while for those with incomes below \$100 000 per year the elasticity is less than one-third as large. Moreover, high income taxpayers who itemize are particularly responsive to taxation. Our estimates suggest that optimal tax structures may feature tightly targeted transfers to lower income taxpayers and a flat or even declining marginal rate structure for middle and high income taxpayers. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {We consider estimation of panel data models with sample selection when the equation of interest contains endogenous explanatory variables as well as unobserved heterogeneity. Assuming that appropriate instruments are available, we propose several tests for selection bias and two estimation procedures that correct for selection in the presence of endogenous regressors. The tests are based on the fixed effects two-stage least squares estimator, thereby permitting arbitrary correlation between unobserved heterogeneity and explanatory variables. The first correction procedure is parametric and is valid under the assumption that the errors in the selection equation are normally distributed. The second procedure estimates the model parameters semiparametrically using series estimators. In the proposed testing and correction procedures, the error terms may be heterogeneously distributed and serially dependent in both selection and primary equations. Because these methods allow for a rather flexible structure of the error variance and do not impose any nonstandard assumptions on the conditional distributions of explanatory variables, they provide a useful alternative to the existing approaches presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of control fonction (CF) methods for solving the problem of endogenous explanatory variables (EEVs) in linear and nonlinear models. CF methods often can be justified in situations where "plug-in " approaches are known to produce inconsistent estimators of parameters and partial effects. Usually, CF approaches require fewer assumptions than maximum likelihood, and CF methods are computationally simpler. The recent focus on estimating average partial effects, along with theoretical results on nonparametric identification, suggests some simple, flexible parametric CF strategies. The CF approach for handling discrete EEVs in nonlinear models is more controversial but approximate solutions are available.},

                                elasticities of giving. Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the
                                price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin
                                elasticity of about -0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of -0.1,
                                yielding a total elasticity of about -0.3. To further explore the
