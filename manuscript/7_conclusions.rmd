# Conclusions

In this paper, we investigate the giving price elasticity using South Korean panel data. As a result, we obtain the following findings.

Firstly, the estimation shows that the giving price elasticity in Korea is larger than 1 in the sense of absolute value. Since the standard theoretical literature suggests that if the price elasticity is more elastic than 1 in the sense of absolute value, the subsidy for the charitable giving should be increased [@Saez2004]. Thus, the result suggests that the Korean government should increase the subsidy for the charitable giving.

Secondly, we find that, although some of the estimated values seem vulnerable depending on the estimation method, most of the results show that the giving price elasticity is more elastic for extensive margin than intensive margin. Since the extensive margin was not paid much attention to in the literature, this result suggests that the consideration about the extensive margin is important.

From the results, we firstly show the giving price elasticity in Korea. However, many things to be considered are remaining. To understand the giving behavior and to contribute the policy making, more sophisticated research is needed.
