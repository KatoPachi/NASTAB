## Tax relief for charitable giving by tax deduction and tax credit

<!-- For Slides
In the South Korea, the tax policy about charitable giving drastically changed in 2014. Before then, tax relief of charitable giving was provided by tax deduction while, from 2014, tax relief by tax credit was introduced instead of tax deduction. 

The tax deduction and tax credit may have different effects on giving behavior. 
This section summarize the difference of tax deduction and tax credit.

## Budget Set

Consider that a household has a choice between private consumptions ($x_i$) and charitable giving ($g_i$). Let $y_i$ be pre-tax total income.
Then, the budget constraint is 

$$
    x_i + g_i = y_i - T_i(y_i, g_i).
$$
$T_i$ is tax amount which depends on the pre-tax income and charitable giving.

## Tax Deduction

Tax deduction reduces taxable income by giving, that is,

$$
    T_i = \tau(y_i - g_i) \cdot (y_i - g_i),
$$

where $\tau(\cdot)$ is the marginal income tax rate which is determined by $y_i - g_i$. The budget constraint will be 

$$
    x_i + [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)]g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)] y_i.
$$

The relative price of giving is $p_i^{d} \equiv 1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)$.
Since the giving price in tax deduction scheme varies depending on (1) the income level and (2) the amount of charitable giving, it is endogenous to them.

## Tax Credit

Tax credit reduces tax amount directly, that is,

$$
    T_i = \tau(y_i)\cdot y_i - m g_i,
$$

where $m \in [0, 1]$ is the tax credit rate. Under the tax credit system, the budget constraint is 

$$
    x_i + (1 - m) g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i)] y_i.
$$

The relative price of giving is $p_i^c = 1 - m$, 
which is only dependent on the tax credit rate $m$, which is exogenously determined by the government.

In the South Korea, the tax policy about charitable giving drastically changed in 2014. Before then, tax relief of charitable giving was provided by tax deduction while, from 2014, tax relief by tax credit was introduced instead of tax deduction. 

The tax deduction and tax credit may have different effects on giving behavior. This subsection summarize the difference of tax deduction and tax credit.
Consider that a household has a choice between private consumptions ($x_i$) and charitable giving ($g_i$). Let $y_i$ be pre-tax total income.
Then, the budget constraint is 

$$
    x_i + g_i = y_i - T_i(y_i, g_i).
$$
$T_i$ is tax amount which depends on the pre-tax income and charitable giving.
On one hand, tax deduction reduces taxable income by giving. The amount of tax is

$$
    T_i = \tau(y_i - g_i) \cdot (y_i - g_i),
$$

where $\tau(\cdot)$ is the income tax rate which is determined by $y_i - g_i$.[^ATR] The budget constraint will be 

[^ATR]: $\tau(\cdot)$ here is a function which shows the average tax rate, which is determined progressively. Since the price elasticity of giving shows the marginal and additional increment for one unit of price reduction increase, we use not average but marginal tax rate to construct the giving price following the literature. Usage of the function of the average tax rate here is for explanatory simplicity.

$$
    x_i + [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)]g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)] y_i.
$$

Thus, the giving price compared to the price of private consumption is $p_i^{d} \equiv 1 - \tau(y_i - g_i)$ in tax deduction system. Since the giving price in tax deduction scheme varies depending on (1) the income level and (2) the amount of charitable giving, it is endogenous to them, i.e. (1) and (2).

On the other hand, tax credit reduces tax amount directly, that is,

$$
    T_i = \tau(y_i)\cdot y_i - m g_i,
$$

where $m \in [0, 1]$ is the tax credit rate. Under the tax credit system, the budget constraint is 

$$
    x_i + (1 - m) g_i = [1 - \tau(y_i)] y_i.
$$

Thus, the giving price of tax credit system will be $p_i^c = 1 - m$, which is only dependent on the tax credit rate $m$, which is exogenously determined by the government.
Therefore, the giving price in the tax credit system would not be manipulated by donors.

## Korean tax reform in 2014

<!--- For Slides

- The tax incentives for charitable giving in Korea stared in 2000 and the market of charitable giving in Korea totaled 10.9 trillion KRW (approximately 1.09 bilion USD, 0.761% of GDP) in 2012 according to the national tax statistics.
- Since the income tax deduction was initially used as a tax incentive and the marginal income tax rate was determined as Table \@ref(tab:tabTaxRate), the minimum giving price before 2014 was 0.62.

The tax incentives for charitable giving in Korea stared in 1967 and the market of charitable giving in Korea totaled 10.9 trillion KRW (approximately 1.09 bilion USD, 0.761% of GDP) in 2012 according to the national tax statistics.
Since the income tax deduction was initially used as a tax incentive and the marginal income tax rate was determined as Table \@ref(tab:tabTaxRate), the minimum giving price before 2014 was 0.62.

<!---In addition, the government set the limit of charitable giving deduction, which was initially the 5\% of income. The government gradually expanded the limit and it finally became 30\% in 2012 and this rate continues until now.

## Our Identification Strategy

-->

In 2014, aiming at the relaxation of regressivity of giving price, the Korean government reformed tax system again, where the tax credit was introduced instead of tax deduction. Since then, 15\% of the total amount of charitable giving has been allowed as a tax credit, which means that the giving price from 2014 is 0.85 irrelevant to the income level.

Summarizing this, compared to tax credit system, the high income household, whose (average) income tax rate is more than 15\%, get benefit from charitable giving under the tax deduction system. However, middle or low income households would enjoy tax relief in tax credit system more than tax deduction system. We exploit this policy change as an identification strategy.
