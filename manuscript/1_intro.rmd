# Introduction
## Background of South Korea Tax Reform

To investigate the price effect, we use the 2014 tax reform in the South Korea
[@Bursztyn2017].

- Before 2014, tax deduction was adopted to subsidize charitable donation behavior.
- After 2014, tax credit have been adopted.

The main difference is that tax credits reduce taxes directly, while tax deductions indirectly lower the tax burden by decreasing the taxpayerâ€™s marginal tax rate, which increases with gross income

## Charitable Giving and Governement Policy

There are huge literatures to investigate relationship bewteen chariable giving and governement policies

1. price elasticity of charitable giving using the tax benefit
1. the crowd-out effect of government expenditure

Even though tax benefits directly affect government expenditure,
there is no literature to try to connect the tax benefit with governement expenditure as far as we know.

We investigate the price effect and the crowd-out effect simultaneously,
and connect two effects through political trust.

## Why Political Trust?

We conjecture that the political trust is key driver to determine the price effect and the crowd-out effect 

- Price effect: If people untrust politicians, then they may also suspect the system of tax banefit. If people trust politicians sufficiently, then they may try to send money to government. Thus, they do not use the tax benefit which decreases governement's revenue.
- Crowd-out effect: If people untrust politicians, then they may expect that governement does not invest the public goods. This is related with the strategic uncertainty.
