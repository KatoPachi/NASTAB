# Introduction

## Charitable Giving and Taxiation

In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving.
This is because, if subsidizing charitable giving induces a large increase in donations, it is desirable.

To evaluate the effect of tax relief, it is needed to know the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price. 

## Charitable Giving and Taxiation

In addition to the tax price charitable donations, the donations may be affected by people's perception towards the government. 

This is because the works and missions of private charity often mirror or overlap with one of governments, and the charity is not needed if the government adequately satisfies the needs of society.

Thus, the different perception towards the government may make the different behavior for charitable giving.

We investigate the relation between tax price elasticity of charitable donations and the different perception towards the government using the South Korean dataset.

## Summary in short

## South Korean tax reform

We can utilize the effect of the 2014 tax reform in the South Korea.

- Before 2014, tax deduction was adopted to subsidize charitable donation behavior.
- After 2014, tax credit have been adopted.

The main difference is that tax credits reduce taxes directly, while tax deductions indirectly lower the tax burden by decreasing the marginal tax rate, which increases with gross income.

In addition, the dataset contains the information about perception towards the government.


## Related Literature

This study mainly relates to the two strands of studies.

 1. Research about tax price elasticity of charitable donations
 2. Research about perception towards the government and donation/tax payment.
  

## Research about tax price elasticity of charitable donations

Papers in this strand examines the price and income elasticity of charitable donations using the tax deduction applied for donation.
The estimated price elasticities vary, but the typical one is said as -1 (Andreoni and Payne, 2013).
  
  - Auten et al.(2002): -0.79~-1.26 (the U.S.)
  - Fack and Landais(2010): -0.15~-0.57 (France)
  - Bakija and Heim (2011): -0.61~-1.1 (the U.S.)
  - Duquette (2016): -2.15~-5.01 (the U.S.)
  - Almunia et al.(2020): -0.24~--1.5 (the U.K.)
  
The study in non-Western country, where the culture of donation may be different, is few.
Thus, we firstly examine the elasticity of giving in Korea.

## Research about perception towards the government and donation/tax payment.

Experimental studies show that the giving behavior may be affected by perception towards the government.

 - Li et al.(2011) suggest that governmental organizations collect less donation than private charities though they have the same mission and work.
 - Sheremeta and Uler(2020) show that individuals provide public good reacting the wasteful spending of government.

This may be because people with distrust in government think that

 1. the direct donation is more efficient than public service provision or
 2. people can directly allocate and control their funds by donation, unlike public service provision. 

Thus, people having the different trust in the government would have different elasticities of giving.

## Why Political Trust?

We conjecture that the political trust is key driver to determine the price effect and the crowd-out effect 

- Price effect: If people untrust politicians, then they may also suspect the system of tax banefit. If people trust politicians sufficiently, then they may try to send money to government. Thus, they do not use the tax benefit which decreases governement's revenue.
- Crowd-out effect: If people untrust politicians, then they may expect that governement does not invest the public goods. This is related with the strategic uncertainty.
