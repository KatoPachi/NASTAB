## Tax incetive of charitable giving 

- In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving.
    - Tax incentive affects relative price of giving in terms of consumptions. $\to$ allocation b/w private consumptions and donations.
- Many papers investigate the elasticity of charitable donations w.r.t. their tax price.
    - @Randolph1995: 
    - @Auten2002: -0.79~-1.26 (the U.S.)
    - @Fack2010: -0.15~-0.57 (France)
    - @Bakija2011: -0.61~-1.1 (the U.S.)
    - @Duquette2016: -2.15 ~ -5.01 (the U.S.)
    - @Almunia2020: -0.24~--1.5 (the U.K.)

## Tax incentive and government efficiency

- At the same time, using tax incentive reduces government's revenue, which leads to a reduction of public goods provision by government.
- This causes relative ability of public goods provision by government in terms of by donations.
    - If the government can provide public goods more efficiently than the direct donations, relative ability of public goods provision by government is high
    - $\to$ this reduces the relative price of public goods provision by governement in terms of by donations [@Saez2004].
- Tax incentive also affects allocation problem b/w public goods provision by governement and by donations.
    - @Li2011 and @Sheremeta2020 shows that giving behavior may be affected by perception towards the government

## Our research questions

Using the South Korean panel data, we will investigate

1. the price elasticity of giving
    - It is worth estimating the price elasticity of donations in non-Western country because the study in non-Western country, where the culture of donation may be different, is few.
2. whether the different perception towards the government would have different elasticities of giving.
    - To our knowledge, there is no literature which investigates the relation b/w perception towards governement and price elasticity of giving.

## South Korean tax reform

- We utilize the effect of the 2014 tax reform in South Korea.
    - ~ 2013: **tax deduction** was adopted to subsidize charitable donation behavior.
    - 2014 ~: **tax credit** have been adopted.
    - The main difference is that tax credits reduce taxes directly, while tax deductions indirectly lower the tax burden by decreasing the marginal tax rate, which increases with gross income.

## Summary in short

Our result classifies that:

- the price elasticity of giving in Korea is -1.07 ~ -1.26, which is within the range of the extant research.
- the giving price elasticity of those who regard government as inefficient is more elastic than the others. This means that those who think of government as inefficient have more willingness to donate for 1\% reduction of giving price.

# Introduction

In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving. This is because, if subsidizing charitable giving induces a large increase in donations, it is desirable for public good provision. To evaluate the effect of tax relief, many papers investigate the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price [@Randolph1995; @Auten2002; @Fack2010; @Bakija2011; @Almunia2020]. Focusing on the tax deduction or tax credit on the charity, they show that the price elasticity of giving is about -1 or more in terms of absolute value, which means that the tax relief for the charitable giving is good in the sense that 1\% tax relief derives more than 1\% donation.

However, if the government can provide public good more efficiently than the direct donation, the donation may not be preferable because the public good provision via donation would be costly then.
Moreover, when the government is much more efficient than charities, people may not donate so much even if they have a warm-glow preference. @Saez2004 suggests that the change of the relative price between public good provision by donation and government will change the behavior of people and the price elasticity of donation. 
However, the evaluation about the efficiency of the government is usually subjective and different for people. If someones regard the government as efficient, the perceived relative price of giving would be high for them. Thus, the giving behavior would be affected by the subjective perception towards the government.

Considering these points, this paper investigates (1) the price elasticity of giving and (2) whether the different perception towards the government cause the different giving behavior using South Korean panel data. 
Our first main concern is the price elasticity of charity. South Korea (Korea hereafter) experienced the tax reform in 2014, from when the tax relief on charitable giving was conducted by tax credit, though tax deduction had been used before 2014. Thus, we exploit this tax reform as an exogenous policy change to derive the price elasticity of giving. Since the extant research focus on the tax reform within the scheme of tax deduction or tax credit, this paper firstly deals with the tax reform from tax deduction system to tax credit system.
Our result classifies that the price elasticity of giving in Korea is -0.59 ~ -1.01 for intensive margin and -1.17 ~ -1.48 for extensive margin. 

Our second concern is the relationship between the giving behavior and the perception towards the government. As we explained, people feeling administrative inefficiency would consider the direct donation is more efficient and would have more willingness to donate. Using the Korean field data, we investigate this and show that  the giving price elasticity of those who regard government as inefficient is more elastic than the others. This means that those who think of government as inefficient have more willingness to donate for 1\% reduction of giving price. 

This paper contributes two strands of charitable giving literature: the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price and the perception of government's inefficiency. The examples of papers in the first strand are @Randolph1995, @Auten2002, @Fack2010, @Bakija2011, and @Almunia2020. They typically use the tax return data, the main part of which is the data about wealthy people. Since our data is based on survey, which reflects the income distribution of population, we believe that we can estimate the giving price elasticity of population more precisely. Using the data with low-income households may be difficult to estimate the giving price elasticity in terms of intensive margin since they are expected to donate less than high-income households. To address this issue, we estimate not only the elasticity of intensive margin, as most of papers do, but also the elasticity of extensive margin following @Almunia2020. 
Moreover, we use the data of Korea, a non-Western country, which the extant research did not examine.[^Culture] 

[^Culture]:This point may be important since @Kim2021 reports that the giving behavior is strongly affected by the cultural matter such as the religious belief.

In the second strand, there are some experimental studies and papers considering the tax evasion. Using an experiment, @Li2011 compare people's willingness to give money for private charities and government agencies whose missions are the same. They show that people tend to donate for private charities more than government agency though they do not directly investigate the relationship between people's perception toward the government and giving behavior. @Sheremeta2020 show that people increase the voluntary public good provision when they face the wasteful government spending in the experimental setting. Although the government in their setting does not provide public good, they suggest that the willingness for donation may increase if people perceive the inefficiency of government. In the tax evasion literature, several paper suggests the perceived inefficiency of government reduce tax morale [@Frey2007; @Hammar2009; @Anderson2017]. We contribute on this literature by showing the relation between the perception of government efficiency and the giving behavior. 

This paper consist of seven sections. Section 2 and 3 respectively explain the institutional background and data. Section 4 explains the estimation method. Section 5 deals with the analysis of giving price elasticity and section 6 shows the analysis of perceptions toward the government. Section 7 concludes.
