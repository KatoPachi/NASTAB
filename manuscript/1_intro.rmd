## Charitable Giving and Taxiation
In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving.

To evaluate the effect of tax relief, many papers investigate the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price [@Randolph1995; @Auten2002; @Fack2010; @Bakija2011; @Almunia2020].

Focusing on the tax deduction or tax credit on the charity, they show that the price elasticity of giving is about -1 or more in terms of absolute value.

## Charitable Giving and Taxiation

In addition to the tax price charitable donations, the donations may be affected by people's perception towards the government. 

This is because the works and missions of private charity often mirror or overlap with one of governments, and the charity is not needed if the government adequately satisfies the needs of society.

Thus, the different perception towards the government may make the different behavior for charitable giving.

We investigate the relation between tax price elasticity of charitable donations and the different perception towards the government using the South Korean dataset.


## Summary in short

Our result classifies that:

- the price elasticity of giving in Korea is -1.07 ~ -1.26, which is within the range of the extant research.
- the amount of donation is not different between those who regard government as inefficient and the others.
- the giving price elasticity of those who regard government as inefficient is more elastic than the others. This means that those who think of government as inefficient have more willingness to donate for 1\% reduction of giving price. 

## South Korean tax reform

We can utilize the effect of the 2014 tax reform in the South Korea.

- Before 2014, tax deduction was adopted to subsidize charitable donation behavior.
- After 2014, tax credit have been adopted.

The main difference is that tax credits reduce taxes directly, while tax deductions indirectly lower the tax burden by decreasing the marginal tax rate, which increases with gross income.

In addition, the dataset contains the information about perception towards the government.


## Related Literature

This study mainly relates to the two strands of studies.

 1. Research about tax price elasticity of charitable donations
 2. Research about perception towards the government and donation/tax payment.
  

## Research about tax price elasticity of charitable donations

Papers in this strand examines the price and income elasticity of charitable donations using the tax deduction applied for donation.
The estimated price elasticities vary, but the typical one is said as -1 (Andreoni and Payne, 2013).
  
  - Auten et al.(2002): -0.79~-1.26 (the U.S.)
  - Fack and Landais(2010): -0.15~-0.57 (France)
  - Bakija and Heim (2011): -0.61~-1.1 (the U.S.)
  - Duquette (2016): -2.15~-5.01 (the U.S.)
  - Almunia et al.(2020): -0.24~--1.5 (the U.K.)
  
The study in non-Western country, where the culture of donation may be different, is few.
Thus, we firstly examine the elasticity of giving in Korea.

## Research about perception towards the government and donation/tax payment.

Experimental studies show that the giving behavior may be affected by perception towards the government.

 - Li et al.(2011) suggest that governmental organizations collect less donation than private charities though they have the same mission and work.
 - Sheremeta and Uler(2020) show that individuals provide public good reacting the wasteful spending of government.

This may be because people with distrust in government think that

 1. the direct donation is more efficient than public service provision or
 2. people can directly allocate and control their funds by donation, unlike public service provision. 

Thus, people having the different trust in the government would have different elasticities of giving.

In many countries, governments set a tax relief for charitable giving. This is because, if subsidizing charitable giving induces a large increase in donations, it is desirable for public good provision. As @Saez2004 shows, it is known that the price elasticity of charitable donations is a key parameter to evaluate the welfare implication. Moreover, to evaluate the effect of tax relief, many empirical papers investigate the elasticity of charitable donations with respect to their tax price [@Randolph1995; @Auten2002; @Fack2010; @Bakija2011; @Almunia2020]. 

This paper follows the literature of charitable donation and tax relief and investigates the price elasticity of giving. To derive the elasticity, this paper utilize the South Korean (Korea hereafter) tax reform in 2014, from when the tax relief on charitable giving was conducted by tax credit, though tax deduction had been used before 2014.

The extant research mainly focuses on the tax reform within the regime of tax deduction [@Randolph1995; @Auten2002; @Bakija2011; @Almunia2020] or tax credit [@Fack2010]. However, there is no research which deal with the giving tax reform between the regime of tax deduction and tax credit as far as we know. Since the extant research focus on the tax reform within the scheme of tax deduction or tax credit, this paper firstly deals with the tax reform from tax deduction system to tax credit system. 

The Korean tax reform in 2014 started to allow 15\% of the total amount of charitable giving as a tax credit for all taxpayers, which means that the giving price for 1 KRW donation is 0.85 KRW. Since the giving price was determined according to the marginal tax rate of progressive income tax before 2014, this tax reform reduced the giving price for low income taxpayers while it increased the price for high income tax payers. Since the variation of giving price can be considered to be exogenous for taxpayers, we exploit this reform and conduct the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis following the extant research. As a result, our baseline estimation shows that the price elasticity of charitable giving in Korea is -0.59 ~ -1.01 for intensive margins and -1.17 ~ -1.48 for extensive margins. 

This baseline estimation actually estimate intention-to-treat (ITT) of tax relief since it assumes that the donors can automatically enjoy tax relief although tax payers have to declare their charitable giving to receive tax relief. Therefore, we calculate an "effective" giving price considering whether each tax payer declare tax relief or not and tax rate. However, whether tax payers declare or not may be endogenous with the amount of charitable giving. To overcome this issue, we focus on the fact that wage earners can easily declare tax relief in their company while self-employed workers have to declare tax relief via tax agency in Korea. By utilizing this difference as an instrument variable (IV), we estimate the price elasticity using the effective giving price, and compare the estimation with the baseline estimation. As a result, we find that the estimation using the effective price is -0.94 ~ -1.16, which is almost the same for the baseline one in terms of intensive margins, while the estimated price elasticity using the effective price is -0.11 ~ -0.17, which is much smaller than the baseline one in terms of extensive margins. This implies that the existence of tax relief does not affect the decision whether to donate or not so much and the declaration cost of tax relief is larger than the literature assumed. 

This paper contributes the literature about the charitable giving tax system for the following points. Firstly, this paper considers the price elasticity of charitable giving using the effective giving price, although most of papers assume that the giving price applied for the charitable giving is the cheapest "applicable" giving price for each tax payer. Since our result shows that the estimation using the effective price and the applicable price is very different, we find that the declaration cost of tax relief mitigate the effect of tax relief.

Secondly, by using the survey data, which cannot be manipulated, we could consider the sample of low-income household. The research in this literature typically use the tax return data, the main part of which is the data about wealthy people. Since our data is based on survey, which reflects the income distribution of population, we believe that we can estimate the giving price elasticity of population more precisely. Moreover, the usage of survey data is important for the estimation of the price elasticity in terms of the extensive margin since the propensity of donation by low-income households would be be less than high-income households. 

Thirdly, this paper is the first paper to examine the giving price elasticity in a non-Western country. While the giving behavior may be affected by the cultural matter such as the religious belief, the estimated price elasticity in this paper is in line with the result of the extant papers.

This paper consist of seven sections. Section 2 and 3 respectively explain the institutional background and data. Section 4 explains the estimation method. Section 5 deals with the analysis of price elasticity using the applicable giving price and section 6 shows the analysis using the effective giving price. Section 7 concludes.
