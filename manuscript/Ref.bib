   Protestantism do not significantly respond to tax incentives, although
   they are the most philanthropic group of all religious groups studied.
   (3) Political preference significantly affects donation behavior,

   progressives. Our results provide evidence that giving intention is not

   contribution good has also a public good effect on all individuals in
   the economy. The government imposes linear taxes on earnings and on the
   contribution good so as to maximize welfare. The government may also
   finance directly the contribution good out of tax revenue. Optimal tax
   and subsidy rates on earnings and the contribution good are expressed in
   terms of empirically estimable parameters and the redistributive tastes
   of the government. The optimal subsidy on the contribution good is
   increasing in the size of the price elasticity of contributions, the
   size of the crowding out effect of public contributions on private
   contributions, and the size of the public good effect of the
   contribution good. Numerical simulations show that the optimal subsidy
   on contributions is fairly sensitive to the size of these parameters but
   that, in most cases, it should be lower than the earnings tax rate. (C)

   contributions in the UK, using the universe of self-assessment income
   tax returns between 2005 and 2013. We exploit variation from a large
   reform in 2010 to estimate intensive- and extensive-margin tax-price
   elasticities of giving. Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the
   price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin
   elasticity of about -0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of -0.1,
   yielding a total elasticity of about -0.3. To further explore the
   extensive-margin response, we propose a model with a fixed cost of
   declaring donations and obtain a structural estimate of that cost of
   around 47 pound. We also study the welfare effects of tax incentives,
   extending the theoretical literature to allow for extensive-margin
   giving and for a fixed cost of declaring donations. Taking into account
   these factors, there is a case for increasing the subsidy on charitable
   giving in the UK. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   individuals make donations to charities knowing that the government
   collects a flat-rate tax on income (net of charitable donations) and
   redistributes part of the tax revenue. The rest of the tax revenue is
   wasted. The model predicts that a higher tax rate increases charitable
   donations. Surprisingly, the model shows that a higher degree of waste
   decreases donations (when the elasticity of marginal utility with
   respect to consumption is high enough). We test the model's predictions
   using a laboratory experiment with actual donations to charities and
   find that the tax rate has an insignificant effect on giving. The degree
   of waste, however, has a large, negative and highly significant effect
   on giving.}},

We find large variation across taxes, highlighting the importance of studying different taxes separately rather than treating tax evasion as one common phenomenon. We focus on the importance of trust in taxpayers and in politicians. Those who do not trust their fellow citizens are more likely to believe that they are evading taxes, but distrust in politicians has an even greater effect, especially for redistributive and fiscally motivated taxes. Hence, it is important for politicians to be perceived as trustworthy in order to be able to collect taxes for maintaining the welfare state.},
