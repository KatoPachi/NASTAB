\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Governments set a tax relief for charitable giving

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if subsidizing charitable giving induces a large increase in donations, it is desirable for public good provision.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Key parameter to evaluate social welfare: the price elasticity of charitable donations (Saez, 2004)

\begin{frame}{Literatures: Price Elasticity of Giving}
\protect\hypertarget{literatures-price-elasticity-of-giving}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large empirical literatures examining the giving price elasticity estimate log-log demand function to derive the giving price elasticity
\item
  Two types of data

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tax filing data: Randolph, 1995; Auten et al., 2002; Fack and Landais, 2010; Bakija and Heim, 2011; Almunia et al., 2020
  \item
    panel survey data: Rehavi and Shack, 2013; Yoruk, 2013; Zampelli and Yen, 2016; Backus and Grant, 2019
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Issue: Although many of these papers consider the endogeneity issue such as the endogenous change of the marginal tax rate by the amount of giving, they pay less attention to the problems caused by the fact that \color{red}{tax payers have to declare their charitable giving to receive tax relief on charitable giving}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Literatures: Tax Compliance}
\protect\hypertarget{literatures-tax-compliance}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Existence of compliance costs to apply measures of tax relives because everyone will apply the measures if there is no compliance cost.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tax payers apply the measures of tax relives only if their benefits from the measures exceed the compliance costs.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recent papers insist this point and suggest that the measures of tax relives may not work as the policy makers expected
\item
  They also suggest compliance costs (e.g.~record-keeping cost and a fee for accountants) are considerably high.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    individual income tax (Benzarti, 2020); corporate income tax (Zwick, 2021); charitable giving (Fack and Landais, 2016;Gillitzer and Skov, 2018; Almunia et al., 2020)

\begin{frame}{What Our Paper Did}
\protect\hypertarget{what-our-paper-did}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We bridge price elasticity of giving and self-selection of tax incentive

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    As long as we know, there is no paper in the literature of giving price elasticity consider the self selection problem
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We estimate the giving price elasticity using the South Korean (Korea, hereafter) survey panel data called the National Survey of Tax and Benefit (NaSTaB)
\item
  Why South Korea?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compliance costs for wage earners and self-employed workers are different (IV)
  \item
    We could consider the sample of low-income households, which are sometimes omitted from the tax filer data.
  \item
    We can exploit the South Korean tax reform in 2014 as a main identification strategy of price change (income deduction \(\to\) tax credit)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What Our Paper Found}
\protect\hypertarget{what-our-paper-found}{}
Using the IV representing the compliance cost,

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Intensive-margin price elasticities are in the range between \(XXX\) and \(XXX\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    FE model w/o IV: \(XXX\) (similar value to the estimates in the existing literature)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Extensive-margin price elasticities are in the range between \(YYY\) and \(YYY\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    FE model w/o IV: \(YYY\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We examine well-known issues in the robustness check

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  intensive-margin tax-price elasticities are in the range of -2 and -1.5
\item
  extensive-margin tax-price elasticities are in the range of -5 and -1.7

\section{Institutional background and Sources of Endogeneity}\label{background}}

\begin{frame}{Framework}
\protect\hypertarget{framework}{}
Consider that a household with pre-tax income \(y_i\) has a choice between private consumption \(x_i\) and charitable giving \(g_i\).

Their budget constraint can be shown as
\begin{align}
x_i + g_i = y_i - R_iK_i - R_iT(y_i, g_i) - (1-R_i)T(y_i). \label{eq:budget}
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(T\) is tax amount which depends on the pre-tax income and charitable giving. Assume \(T_y(\cdot)>0\) and \(T_{yy}(\cdot)>0\).
\item
  \(R_i\) is the dummy which takes 1 if \(i\) declares the tax relief and 0 otherwise.
\item
  \(K_i\) is a fixed compliance cost for the declaration of charitable giving.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the literature about the giving price elasticity, most of papers implicitly assume \(R_i=1\) and \(K_i=0\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decision Rule of Tax Relief}
\protect\hypertarget{decision-rule-of-tax-relief}{}
\begin{align}
  R_i = \begin{cases}
      1 \text{ if }T(y_i, g_i) + K_i<T(y_i)\\
      0 \text{ if }T(y_i, g_i) + K_i\ge T(y_i). \label{eq:R}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

where

\begin{align}
  T(y_i, g_i) =
  \begin{cases} 
      T(y_i-g_i)&\text{ if tax relief is applied by income deduction.}\\
      T(y_i)-mg_i &\text{ if tax relief is applied by tax credit.} \label{eq:relief}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Giving Price}
\protect\hypertarget{giving-price}{}
Let us differentiate the budget constraint \eqref{eq:budget} by \(x_i\) and \(g_i\).
Then, it derives that the giving price (relative to the private consumption) is
\(\frac{dx_i}{dg_i}=1+R_iT_g(y_i,g_i)\), which we denote \(p\).

\begin{align}
    p=
    \begin{cases} 
        1-R_iT'(y_i-g_i)&\text{ if tax relief is applied by income deduction.}\\
        1-R_im&\text{ if tax relief is applied by tax credit.}\label{giving price}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
Hereafter,
let us \(q\) to show the amount of tax relief for each declared giving
(i.e.~\(p=1-R_iq\) and \(q=-T_g(y_i, g_i)\)).
The government can change \(q\) by the tax reform.

\item
  To mitigate the administrative cost, the Korean National Tax Service introduce different taxation methods and different ways of giving declaration for wage earners and self-employed workers.
\item
  There is a difference of compliance cost of tax relief between self-employed and wage earners

  \begin{itemize}

Wage earners:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Wage earners pay income tax by tax withholding and can declare their giving via their company at anytime
\item
  Instead of them, their company is supposed to close the comprehensive income tax return including giving declaration through year-end settlement
\end{itemize}

Self-employed workers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self-employed workers have to calculate the amount of income earned during a year and pay income tax through tax return by May of the following year.
\item
  To receive tax relief on charitable giving, they have to submit the certificate of donations when they submit tax return.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Before 2014, tax relief on charitable giving is conducted by income deduction in Korea.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tax payer facing the higher marginal income tax rate can enjoy the lower giving price for each 1 KRW of donation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In 2014, aiming at the relaxation of regressivity of giving price, the Korean government reformed tax system, where the tax credit was introduced instead of income deduction.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    15\% of the total amount of charitable giving has been allowed as a tax credit,
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{2014 Tax Reform (2)}
\protect\hypertarget{tax-reform-2}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compared to tax credit system, the high income household, whose (average) income tax rate is more than 15\%,
  get benefit from charitable giving under the income deduction system.
\item
  However, middle or low income households would enjoy tax relief in tax credit system more than income deduction system.
\item
  We exploit the variation of giving price brought from the policy change as a main identification source to estimate the giving price elasticity.
