  This paper investigates the price elasticity of charitable giving utilizing South Korean tax reform in 2014, when the tax relief on charitable giving changed from tax deduction to tax credit. Although many research on the price elasticity of charitable giving implicitly assume that all of tax payers declare their tax relief on charitable givieng, this paper considers the existence of declaration cost for tax reliefs on charitable giving.
  By estimating the "intension-to-treat" effect (ITT) of tax reform, the analysis shows that the giving price elasticity is about -1 in terms of both intensive and extensive margins. Furthermore, considering the declaration of charitable giving and exploiting the different declaration cost between wage earners and self-employed workers as instrument variable (IV), we estimate the effect of "effective" giving price on the donation. As a result, we find that the estimation about the "effective" price elasticity is almost the same for the baseline one in terms of both intensive and extensive margins. This implies that the effect from the declaration cost of charitable giving may be small.
