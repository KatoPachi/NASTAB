Rewards or punishments (whether material or image-related) create doubt about the true motive for which good deeds are performed, and this "overjustification effect" can induce a partial or even net crowding out of prosocial behavior by extrinsic incentives. We also identify the settings that are conducive to multiple social norms and, more generally, those that make individual actions complements or substitutes, which we show depends on whether stigma or honor is (endogenously) the dominant reputational concern. Finally, we analyze the socially optimal level of incentives and how monopolistic or competitive sponsors depart from it. Sponsor competition is shown to potentially reduce social welfare.},

Our results indicate that donors significantly increase the frequency of their donations immediately before reaching the thresholds for which the rewards are given, but only if the prizes are publicly announced in the local newspaper and awarded in a public ceremony. The results are robust to several specifications, sample definitions, and controls for observable and unobservable heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that social image concerns are a primary motivator of prosocial behavior and that symbolic prizes are most effective as motivators when they are awarded publicly.

@article{DellaVigna2012,
abstract = {Every year, 90{\%} of Americans give money to charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9{\%} to 25{\%} and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28{\%} to 42{\%}. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than {\$}10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is {\$}3.80 for an in-state charity and {\$}1.40 for an out-of-state charity. Our welfare calculations suggest that our door-to-door fund-raising campaigns on average lower the utility of the potential donors.},

Solicitors were at one or both of two main entrances to a supermarket, making the solicitation either easy or difficult to avoid. Additionally, solicitors were either silent, or asked "please give" to passersby. We observed over 17,000 passings over four days, and found dramatic avoidance of the solicitors, but only during a direct ask. Furthermore, asking increased donations 75{\%}. Across all conditions, seeking the solicitor was exceedingly rare. The results do not support static views of altruism, such as inequity aversion, and instead highlight the importance of social cues and psychological features of the giver-receiver interaction. We argue that avoidance could evidence a lack of altruism or self-control strategy to deal with empathic reflexes to give.},

The main advantage of this format is that it is relatively transparent to subjects and provides simple incentives for truthful revelation. The main disadvantages are that it only elicits interval responses, and could be susceptible to framing effects. We consider extensions to address and evaluate these concerns. We conclude that although there are framing effects, they can be controlled for with a design that allows for them. We also find that the elicitation of risk attitudes is sensitive to procedures, subject pools, and the format of the multiple price list table, but that the qualitative findings that participants are generally risk averse is robust. The elicitation of discount rates appear less sensitive to details of the experimental design. {\textcopyright} 2006 Economic Science Association.},

This paper analyzes the decisions of a hyperbolic consumer who has access to an imperfect commitment technology: an illiquid asset whose sale must be initiated one period before the sale proceeds are received. The model predicts that consumption tracks income, and the model explains why consumers have asset-specific marginal propensities to consume. The model suggests that financial innovation may have caused the ongoing decline in U. S. savings rates, since financial innovation increases liquidity, eliminating commitment opportunities. Finally, the model implies that financial market innovation may reduce welfare by providing "too much" liquidity.},

We investigate whether merely alerting individuals to an upcoming prosocial ask — that is neither avoided nor occurs in an environment with flexibility — results in reduced prosocial behavior. That is, we investigate whether individuals use time to quickly find ways to decline prosocial asks and thus whether surprising individuals with prosocial asks increases compliance.

Exposure to such messages is, therefore, generally passive.

In this Review we discuss the outcomes of mass media campaigns in the context of various health-risk behaviours (eg, use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, heart disease risk factors, sex-related behaviours, road safety, cancer screening and prevention, child survival, and organ or blood donation). We conclude that mass media campaigns can produce positive changes or prevent negative changes in health-related behaviours across large populations. We assess what contributes to these outcomes, such as concurrent availability of required services and products, availability of community-based programmes, and policies that support behaviour change. Finally, we propose areas for improvement, such as investment in longer better-funded campaigns to achieve adequate population exposure to media messages. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has had remarkable success at recruiting potential bone marrow donors and recently has become increasingly focused on the retention of registered volunteers. This study extends the authors' work examining factors associated with attrition from the registry. Its goal was to determine which characteristics from six psychosocial domains were associated with attrition at two key stages leading to donation. Methods. Questionnaires were mailed to potential donors after they were contacted as a potential match and had decided whether or not to continue toward donation. Our final sample included 1,727 volunteers who decided to continue with typing at the DR stage and 195 volunteers who decided to continue at the confirmatory typing (CT) stage as well as 179 and 169 individuals, respectively, who declined further participation in the registry at DR and CT stages. Results. Bivariate analyses indicated that multiple factors in all six domains (demographics, volunteer-related, general psychosocial, recruitment-related, donation-related, and contact with center staff) were associated with discontinued registry participation. Logistic regression indicated that unique associations were concentrated in volunteer-related, donation-related, and contact with center domains. Conclusions. Findings suggested that intrinsic commitment to donation, more realistic expectations, fewer medical concerns, and greater contact with the donor center were all associated with lower attrition. Possible interventions to reduce attrition are discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate attrition at the finally selected donor stage among British Bone Marrow Registry (BBMR) donors, all recruited from blood donors. Background: The success of searches for unrelated stem cell donors relies on the existence of large international donor registries and the availability of registered donors when matched with a patient. Withdrawal of donors may adversely affect patient outcomes. Materials/Methods: Data on 2942 planned donations were analysed to assess donor-related deferral rates and associated factors. Results: Overall, 20{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} of requests were cancelled. Transplant centres activated more than half of the cancellations (52{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}). Donor reasons accounted for 46{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} of cancellations (9{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} of requests), of which 61{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} happened for medical and 38{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} for personal reasons. Medical ineligibility of the donor was associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1{\textperiodcentered}36, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}011) and peripheral blood stem cell source (OR = 2{\textperiodcentered}22, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}006), and there was some evidence of association with low blood donation reliability (OR = 1{\textperiodcentered}52, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}054). The blood donor reliability score relates to blood donation, and the score worsens if donors consistently fail to attend a donation session when invited. Withdrawal on personal grounds showed associations with donor age (OR = 1{\textperiodcentered}72, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}017, 30–40 years vs other ages), peripheral blood stem cell source (OR = 2{\textperiodcentered}43, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}010) and low blood donor reliability (OR = 1{\textperiodcentered}94, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}007). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report on all-cause cancellation at the finally-selected donor stage for international stem cell donor provision, showing 9{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} donor-related cancellation rate. Scores associated with blood donation reliability may be useful to predict stem cell donor withdrawal.},

  abstract  = {We study the effect of social information on the voluntary provision of public goods. Competing theories predict that others' contributions might be either substitutes or complements to one's own. We demonstrate a positive social information effect on individual contributions, supporting theories of complementarities. We find the most influential level of social information is drawn from the 90th to 95th percentile of previous contributions. We furthermore find the effect to be significant for new members but not for renewing members. In the most effective condition, social information increases contributions by 12{\%} ({\$}13). These increased contributions do not crowd out future contributions. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Royal Economic Society.},
