## Summary of this paper (based on my understanding)

- Using the Indian-states panel data from 2003 to 2019, this paper analyzes whether the fiscal grant cause the fly paper effect or not.
- This paper focus on the delegation of some parts of the tax revenue from the central government to some state governments.
    - This delegation is called "tax devolution" or "ecological fiscal transfer (EFT)" in this paper.
    - The tax devolution was done for forest conservation by state governments.
    - The devolution formula depends on the condition of the forests.

 
## Summary of this paper (based on my understanding)

- The panel data analysis finds that the tax devolution increase the expenditure for forest conservation.
- According to the authors, the result about the flypaper effect is mixed.
    
## Fly paper effect (based on my understanding)

The lump-sum transfer from the central government sticks to certain expenditure(s) although it is lump-sum.

## Comment 1

- Considering the flypaper effect, it seems that the analyses on several expenditures are needed.
    - See Kakamu et al. (2014) and Langer and Korzhenevych (2019) for example.
- However, the current version of this paper considers only the expenditure for ecology.
- The analyses on several expenditures are needed.

## Comment 2

- The title of this paper is "Ecological fiscal transfers and local government spending: The flypaper effects in \textbf{the era of pandemic}"
- Which parts are related to the pandemic of Covid-19 in this paper?
    - This paper uses Indian panel data from 2003 to 2019.
    - Is the data affected by the pandemic? If so, why not refer to it in the paper?
    
## Comment 3

- The suitable identification strategy for this paper may be "difference-in-difference" (DD).
    - This is because the tax devolution was distributed to the certain states with forests.
    - Average Treatment Effect on the state with forests may be derived though ATE itself cannot be.
- Please note when the tax devolution began in the paper.

## Minor Comments

- Summary stat must be written in the paper.
- The detailed hypothesis (e.g. the expected sign of coefficients) should be described.
- Interpretations about the results of analyses should be described.
- The omission of outliers seems arbitrary.
